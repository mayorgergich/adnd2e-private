This guide outlines effective combat strategies for Augustus "X" Groß, integrating clerical abilities with eastern monastic combat techniques. These tactics are designed to maximize effectiveness while maintaining the appearance of a traditional cleric when necessary.

== Combat Roles ==

Augustus can fulfill several roles in combat, depending on the situation and party needs:




=== Divine Support Role ===

In this role, Augustus acts primarily as a cleric, focusing on empowering allies while staying relatively safe.

'''Ideal When:'''
- The party needs magical support
- Maintaining clerical appearance is crucial
- Facing multiple weaker enemies that others can handle

'''Key Tactics:'''
1. '''Opening Blessing:''' Begin combat with '''Bless''' to enhance the entire party
2. '''Strategic Positioning:''' Stay behind frontline fighters, using your quarterstaff defensively
3. '''Support Movement:''' Reposition to aid wounded allies with future healing abilities
4. '''Ranged Harassment:''' Use darts when direct engagement is unnecessary

'''Sample Round Sequence:'''
1. Cast '''Bless''' affecting maximum number of allies
2. Move to protected position with good visibility of battlefield
3. Ready quarterstaff defensively or prepare darts for ranged attacks
4. Use darts to attack vulnerable or injured enemies
5. Maintain tactical awareness, ready to aid allies in subsequent rounds





=== Monastic Warrior Role ===

In this role, Augustus reveals more of her eastern training, engaging in direct combat with enhanced effectiveness.

'''Ideal When:'''
- Fighting alongside trusted companions who know her secret
- Facing a serious threat requiring full combat capability

3. '''Combat Mobility:''' Stay mobile, using eastern movement techniques to control positioning
4. '''Targeted Strikes:''' Focus attacks on vulnerable opponents or specific threat points

'''Sample Round Sequence:'''
1. Cast '''Strength of Stone''' on self (pre-combat if possible)
2. Activate '''Meditative Stance''' to improve AC
3. Move quickly to optimal position using monastic movement techniques
4. Attack with quarterstaff using eastern forms for enhanced effectiveness
5. Reposition using remaining movement, maintaining tactical advantage





=== Sacred Fist (Hybrid Role) ===

This balanced approach reveals some monastic techniques but frames them within clerical practice, offering a compromise that maintains cover while enhancing effectiveness.

'''Ideal When:'''
- Fighting alongside partial confidants
- Facing moderate threats
- When a balanced approach is needed

'''Key Tactics:'''
1. '''Divine Enhancement:''' Begin with clerical magic to justify enhanced abilities
2. '''Explained Techniques:''' Use monastic moves but describe them as "divinely inspired"
3. '''Balanced Approach:''' Alternate between obvious divine magic and subtle eastern techniques
4. '''Measured Revelation:''' Gradually demonstrate more advanced techniques as the situation demands

'''Sample Round Sequence:'''
1. Cast '''Bless''' or activate a divine ability (establishing clerical identity)
2. Move into combat position using conventional movement
3. Attack with quarterstaff using subtle eastern techniques
4. Describe any exceptional success as "Saint Sebaldus guides my hand"
5. Maintain position that supports both offense and ally protection






== Weapon Tactics ==




=== Ornate Quarterstaff ===

Your primary weapon combines religious symbolism with practical effectiveness, making it ideal for your dual identity.

'''Advantages:'''
- Acceptable weapon for a cleric of St. Sebaldus
- Versatile for both offense and defense
- Can be used with eastern staff techniques
- Serves as a religious symbol and focusing item

'''Tactical Applications:'''
1. '''Two-Handed Grip:''' Maximize damage (1d6+1) against significant threats
2. '''Defensive Stance:''' Hold staff across body for improved defensive posture
3. '''Controlled Strikes:''' Target specific vulnerabilities (joints, head)
4. '''Versatile Range:''' Use the staff's length to control engagement distance

'''Special Techniques:'''
- '''Sebaldus's Rebuke:''' Quick thrust followed by sweeping strike (describe as divinely guided)
- '''Warding Circle:''' Spinning defensive pattern that appears ceremonial but offers protection
- '''Eastern Extension:''' When using the staff, emphasize it as an "extension of divine will" to mask eastern training





=== Unarmed Combat ===

Your eastern monastery training enables effective unarmed combat, though this should be used selectively to maintain your cover.

'''Advantages:'''
- Always available, even when disarmed
- Can be easily disguised as desperate flailing if needed
- Most effective channel for eastern techniques
- Unexpected from someone perceived as a cleric

'''Tactical Applications:'''
1. '''Emergency Defense:''' When disarmed or cornered
2. '''Secretive Strikes:''' When no witnesses are present
3. '''Precise Targeting:''' Strike pressure points or vulnerable areas
4. '''Grappling Control:''' Immobilize rather than damage when appropriate

'''Special Techniques:'''
- '''Icicle Palm:''' Channel your once-daily ability for a penetrating strike
- '''Saint's Echo:''' Follow a successful strike with a defensive movement, gaining +1 AC
- '''Flowing Water:''' Series of rapid, light strikes that appear desperate but are precisely targeted





=== Eastern-Style Darts ===

Your monastery training includes the use of thrown darts, providing a ranged option that complements your other abilities.

'''Advantages:'''
- Provides ranged attack option
- Can be explained as "unusual but acceptable" clerical weapon
- Lightweight and concealable
- Can be used quickly with minimal preparation

'''Tactical Applications:'''
1. '''Opening Strike:''' Throw before closing to melee range
2. '''Target Softening:''' Weaken enemies before engaging
3. '''Interrupted Spellcasting:''' Target enemy spellcasters to disrupt concentration
4. '''Tactical Retreat:''' Throw while disengaging from dangerous situations

'''Special Techniques:'''
- '''Triple-Throw Sequence:''' With practice, throw up to three darts in quick succession (future ability)
- '''Precision Targeting:''' Aim for exposed flesh or joints with +1 to hit but -2 damage (called shot)
- '''Distraction Toss:''' Throw without expectation of damage to create opening for allies (+2 to next ally's attack)






== Defensive Strategies ==

=== Layered Defense System ===

Augustus employs a multi-layered approach to defense, combining conventional armor with eastern techniques and divine protection.

Physical Protection


* '''Brigandine Armor:''' Primary physical protection (AC 6)
* '''Ornate Buckler:''' Additional protection when needed (improves to AC 5)
* '''Defensive Stance:''' +1 AC when using quarterstaff defensively


Monastic Protection


* '''Meditative Stance (1/day):''' +1 AC for 1 hour (Wisdom modifier)
* '''Saint's Echo (1/encounter):''' +1 AC for 1 turn after successful unarmed hit
* '''Defensive Flow:''' Apply Dexterity bonus to AC when lightly armored
* '''Eastern Reflexes:''' +1 to initiative and saves vs. poison &amp; charm


Divine Protection


* '''Protection from Evil:''' +2 AC against evil creatures
* '''Remove Fear:''' +4 saves vs. fear effects, preventing combat penalties


=== Tactical Movement ===

Proper positioning is essential to maximize your defensive capabilities while maintaining offensive options.

'''Key Movement Principles:'''
1. '''Maintain Space:''' Keep 5-10 feet between you and most enemies
2. '''Control Engagement:''' Use staff length to decide when enemies can reach you
3. '''Positional Awareness:''' Stay aware of terrain features and ally positions

== Situational Tactics ==




=== Group Combat ===

When fighting alongside allies, adapt your approach to complement their strengths.

'''With Heavy Fighters:'''

- Support with '''Bless''' to enhance their effectiveness
- Be ready to step in if they become injured

'''With Ranged Allies:'''
- Serve as a defensive screen, preventing enemies from reaching them
- Use '''Meditative Stance''' to improve your AC when serving as a guardian
- Coordinate targeting to focus fire effectively

'''With Other Spellcasters:'''
- Alternate casting turns to maintain continuous magical support
- Position to protect them while they cast longer spells
- Focus on defensive magic if they provide offensive spells





=== Solo Combat ===

When fighting alone, you can fully utilize your eastern techniques without concern for maintaining appearances.

'''Key Solo Tactics:'''
1. '''Full Arsenal:''' Freely use all monastic abilities
2. '''Environment Usage:''' Utilize furniture, terrain, and obstacles
3. '''Controlled Engagement:''' Choose when and where to engage enemies
4. '''Conservation:''' Manage resources carefully without ally support

'''Sample Solo Sequence:'''

2. Apply self-buffs ('''Strength of Stone''', '''Meditative Stance''')
3. Use darts to thin or weaken approaching enemies
4. Engage primary threat with full eastern combat techniques
5. Maintain mobility, never allowing yourself to be surrounded





=== Stealth Operations ===

When infiltration or discretion is required, your monastic training provides significant advantages.

2. '''Minimal Equipment:''' Remove noisy equipment when stealth is crucial
3. '''Observation Focus:''' Use meditative awareness to notice details others miss
4. '''Non-Lethal Options:''' Employ disabling rather than killing techniques when appropriate

'''Cover Identity Usage:'''
- Present as a wandering cleric on official church business
- Use noble connections to gain access to restricted areas
- Leverage clerical authority when challenged
- Switch between identities as needed to maintain cover






== Specialized Combat Scenarios ==

=== Against Supernatural Threats ===

The rising Hussite conflict and supernatural beliefs prevalent in 1420s Nuremberg make encounters with spiritual threats possible.

'''Against Demonic/Evil Entities:'''
- Lead with '''Protection from Evil''' for enhanced defense
- Use quarterstaff as primary weapon (described in lore as effective against spirits)
- Channel divine energy through eastern techniques (maximizing both skillsets)
- Use religious authority to attempt to command lesser spirits

'''Against Possession/Mind Control:'''
- Activate '''Remove Fear''' to enhance saves against mental effects
- Use meditative techniques to strengthen mental resistance
- Maintain distance until protection spells are active
- Target the controller rather than the controlled when possible

=== Against Church Opposition ===

As tensions rise in the region, you may face opponents from within the church or state who oppose your actions.

'''Against Church Authorities:'''
- Emphasize your family connections and noble status
- Present conventional clerical abilities, concealing eastern techniques
- Use non-lethal approaches to avoid escalating conflict
- Leverage your knowledge of church politics and hierarchies

'''Against Secular Authorities:'''
- Invoke clerical immunity where applicable
- Use your family's patrician status for protection
- Demonstrate respect while maintaining your position
- Rely on social tactics rather than physical confrontation



== Roleplaying Your Combat Style ==

=== Public Persona vs. Private Techniques ===

As Augustus, you must carefully manage how your combat abilities are perceived by different audiences.

'''Public Combat Style:'''
- Somewhat clumsy but effective staff techniques
- Apparent reliance on divine intervention
- Hesitant, almost reluctant combat approach
- Dramatic invocations to St. Sebaldus

'''Private Combat Style:'''
- Fluid, precise movements revealing eastern training
- Balanced integration of divine and monastic abilities
- Confident, controlled techniques
- Minimal verbal components, focused on breath and form

=== Combat Dialogue Examples ===

'''Public Setting:'''
- "St. Sebaldus guide my hand!" (when attacking)
- "By the grace of Heaven, I stand protected." (when defending)
- "I prefer not to fight, but the church demands justice." (when initiating combat)
- "Most unexpected! The saint has blessed me with unusual strength." (after a particularly effective strike)

'''Private Setting:'''
- Minimal speech, focused on controlled breathing
- "Center. Flow. Strike." (personal mantra)
- "The mountain does not fear the wind." (eastern teaching when facing powerful foes)
- "Both river and stone." (reminder to balance offense and defense)



== Progressive Revelation Strategy ==

As your adventures continue, you may choose to gradually reveal more of your true capabilities to trusted companions. This strategic progression allows for character development while maintaining necessary secrets.

=== Level 1-2: Initial Secrecy ===
