== Current Spell Slots ==

| Level | Slots Per Day |
| :---: | :-----------: |
|   1   |       1       |



== Level 1 Spells Analysis ==

These are the 1st-level spells available to you as a Cleric of St. Sebaldus. Each spell is analyzed for its tactical application in combination with your monastic abilities.




=== Combat Enhancement Spells ===

Spells that directly enhance your combat effectiveness:

| Spell Name                                          | Range  | Duration    | Tactical Application                                                                      |
| --------------------------------------------------- | :----: | :---------: | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|             | 60 yds | 6 rounds    | '''+1 to hit''' for all allies; excellent for opening rounds of significant combat         |
|  | Touch  | 1 turn/lvl  | '''+1 to hit, +1 damage''' for recipient; ideal self-buff before engaging in melee combat |

'''Tactical Considerations:'''
- '''Bless''' affects multiple allies and stacks with any monastic combat bonuses
- '''Strength of Stone''' turns your unarmed strikes into more formidable weapons
- Both spells can be active simultaneously for greater combat effectiveness





=== Protective Magic ===

Spells that enhance your defenses:

| Spell Name                                             | Range  | Duration   | Tactical Application                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | :----: | :--------: | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  | Touch  | 1 rd/level | '''+2 AC''' vs. evil creatures; blocks possession; pairs well with monastic AC bonuses    |
|           | Touch  | 1 rd/level | Removes existing fear; grants '''+4 save''' vs. fear; enables confident aggressive tactics |

'''Tactical Considerations:'''
- '''Protection from Evil''' stacks with your '''Meditative Stance''' and '''Saint's Echo''' abilities
- '''Remove Fear''' ensures you can maintain combat focus even against intimidating supernatural threats
- Consider casting protection spells before entering dangerous areas





=== Utility Magic ===

Spells with broader application:

| Spell Name                                           | Range  | Duration   | Tactical Application                                                                    |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | :----: | :--------: | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  | Touch  | 1 hr/level | Creates light source; useful for night operations without occupying hands during combat |

'''Tactical Considerations:'''
- '''Log of Everburning''' provides light without requiring you to hold a torch, keeping both hands free for combat
- Can be cast on your quarterstaff or on a small object carried by an ally






== Daily Divine Abilities ==

These abilities are granted directly by St. Sebaldus and do not count against your daily spell slots. Each can be used once per day.

| Ability                                                 | Effect                                                             | Tactical Application                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|                 | +1 morale, +1 to hit for allies                                    | Use at the beginning of significant combats                                     |
|  | +2 AC vs. evil; blocks possession                                  | Cast before entering suspected evil areas or confronting supernatural creatures |
|           | Removes existing fear; +4 save vs. fear                            | Use when facing intimidating foes or fear-inducing supernatural effects         |



== Spell Selection Strategy ==

=== Level 1 ===

'''Recommended Memorization Priority:'''
1. '''Bless''' - Most versatile combat enhancer, affects entire party
2. '''Strength of Stone''' - Excellent self-buff for unexpected combat
3. '''Log of Everburning''' - Utility that frees hands for combat

=== Future Levels ===

As you advance, consider these spells that synergize well with monastic combat:

Level 2


* '''Aid''' - Grants +1 to hit, +1 morale, and 1d8 temporary HP
* '''Draw Upon Holy Might''' - Temporarily increases STR, DEX, or CON by 1-4 points
* '''Resist Cold/Fire''' - Important protection when facing elemental threats


Level 3


* '''Prayer''' - Broader version of Bless that also penalizes enemies
* '''Magical Vestment''' - Improves AC of worn armor
* '''Remove Curse''' - Essential utility for a monastic warrior facing supernatural foes




== Integrating Divine and Monastic Abilities ==

=== Complementary Abilities ===

Your monastic training provides abilities that work harmoniously with your divine powers:

| Monastic Ability       | Divine Complement                                 | Combined Effect                                                       |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| '''Icicle Palm'''        | '''Strength of Stone'''                             | Enhanced damage penetration with superior damage bonus                |
| '''Saint's Echo'''       | '''Protection from Evil'''                          | Stacking AC bonuses for superior defense                              |
| '''Meditative Stance'''  | '''Bless'''                                         | Defensive improvement paired with offensive bonus                     |
| '''Eastern Reflexes'''   | '''Remove Fear'''                                   | Improved initiative and resistance to fear effects                    |

=== Roleplaying Integration ===

Your unique background allows you to portray your divine abilities as manifestations of St. Sebaldus working through eastern techniques:


* Describe '''Bless''' as settling into a stance that inspires allies
* Portray '''Protection from Evil''' as a defensive posture channeling divine energy
* Frame '''Remove Fear''' as a meditative breathing technique that channels courage


This approach allows you to use your monastic abilities openly while maintaining the secret of your formal eastern training.



== Prayer and Preparation ==

As a cleric with eastern monastic influences, your daily spell preparation can be portrayed as a unique blend of traditional prayer and meditative practices:


# '''Dawn Prayer Cycle''' - Traditional prayers to St. Sebaldus
# '''Meditative Postures''' - Eastern techniques for mental clarity
# '''Physical Forms''' - Martial stances that channel divine energy
# '''Breath Control''' - Techniques for focusing spiritual energy


This combination allows you to maintain your clerical identity while incorporating your eastern training in a way that appears to be a personal devotional style rather than formal monastic training.



== Secret Techniques ==

These abilities should be used carefully if maintaining the secret of your eastern training:

| Ability                | Public Use                               | Private Use                                   |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| '''Unarmed Combat'''     | Last resort self-defense                 | Primary fighting style when alone or trusted  |
| '''Meditative Stance'''  | Prayer posture                           | Combat stance                                 |
| '''Icicle Palm'''        | "Miracle" of St. Sebaldus               | Eastern chi technique                         |
| '''Defensive Flow'''     | "Divine protection"                      | Trained defensive movement                    |

By framing these abilities in the context of divine miracles or natural talent, you can use them without revealing their true origin.
