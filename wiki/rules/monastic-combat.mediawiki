= Eastern Techniques: Monastic Combat Integration =

This document details how to mechanically implement monk-like combat abilities within your clerical framework, providing practical game mechanics and roleplaying guidance for your unique character concept.

== Core Mechanical Framework ==




=== Sacred Fist Concept ===

The "Sacred Fist" represents your specialized training that combines eastern monastic combat techniques with western clerical traditions. This creates a unique hybrid that functions within AD&amp;D 2e rules.

'''Core Concept:'''
- Primary Class: Cleric (maintaining all standard clerical abilities)
- Secondary Influence: Eastern monastic training
- Implementation: Special abilities that complement rather than replace clerical powers
- Progression: Additional abilities unlocked at higher levels
- Balance: Limited uses per day prevent overpower while enabling character concept

'''Design Philosophy:'''
- Abilities should be balanced against standard clerical abilities
- Eastern techniques should complement rather than replace divine magic
- Combat options should provide tactical flexibility without dominating gameplay
- Abilities should allow for both public (disguised) and private (authentic) use
- System should work within AD&amp;D 2e framework without requiring extensive house rules





=== Sacred Fist Mechanics ===

The mechanical framework for implementing your character's eastern training:

'''Base Statistics:'''
- Retain all normal clerical THAC0 progression
- Use standard clerical saving throws
- Follow normal clerical experience progression
- Maintain clerical weapon and armor restrictions (with specific exceptions)

'''Combat Modifications:'''
- '''Unarmed Damage:''' 1d3 (small/medium opponents)
- '''Staff Specialization:''' +1 to hit with quarterstaff
- '''Initiative Bonus:''' +1 from Eastern Reflexes ability
- '''Armor Usage:''' Retain clerical armor options, but some abilities require light or no armor

'''Special Ability Resource System:'''
- Limited-use special techniques (1-3 times per day depending on ability)
- Some abilities require specific circumstances to activate
- Higher-level abilities require successful use of basic techniques
- Meditation between adventures can restore certain ability uses





=== Sacred Fist Progression ===

How your monastic abilities will develop as you gain levels:

'''Level 1:'''
- Basic eastern defensive abilities
- Fundamental unarmed combat techniques
- Initial quarterstaff specialization
- Limited daily special techniques

'''Levels 2-3:'''
- Improved unarmed damage
- Additional daily technique uses
- Enhanced defensive capabilities
- Better integration with divine abilities

'''Levels 4-6:'''
- Advanced combination techniques
- Expanded eastern medicine knowledge
- Spiritual energy channeling
- Leadership abilities incorporating both traditions

'''Levels 7+:'''
- Master-level combat techniques
- Creation of unique hybrid fighting style
- Teaching capabilities for passing on techniques
- Transformation abilities bridging physical and spiritual

'''Multiclassing Alternative:'''
If your DM allows multiclassing variants, discuss potentially taking limited monk abilities at higher levels while maintaining clerical progression.

|---------------|-------------------------------------------|:-------:|
