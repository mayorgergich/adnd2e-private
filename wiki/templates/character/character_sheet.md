## Background & Personality

### Background

Augustus "X" Groß was born into the prestigious Groß family, one of Nuremberg's patrician houses that form the Inner Council. As the second child, Brayden (her birth name) was destined for the church to extend family influence, while her older brother was groomed to inherit leadership.

From an early age, she struggled with her identity, feeling a profound disconnect between her assigned gender and inner self. Finding solace in religious texts about transformation and rebirth, she adopted the secret identity of "X" ("She Who Has No Name"), a name known only to herself and a few trusted mentors.

Sent east to study at a remote monastery, she not only deepened her religious knowledge but also learned techniques of unarmed combat and meditation from eastern monks. These techniques became both a physical discipline and a spiritual path that helped her cope with her internal struggle.

Upon returning to Nuremberg, she took the name Augustus and assumed her position in the church of St. Sebaldus, maintaining her male public identity for safety while secretly identifying as female. She now navigates the complex political landscape of 1420s Nuremberg, balancing family obligations, church duties, and her own quest for personal authenticity.

### Personality Traits

- Outwardly haughty: Projects a snobbish demeanor to maintain distance
- Inwardly conflicted: Struggles with her true identity and family expectations
- Strategically cowardly: Avoids direct confrontation when possible
- Quietly determined: Pursues knowledge and power to eventually live authentically
- Compartmentalized faith: Genuinely devoted to St. Sebaldus, but pragmatic in application
- Complicated morality: Not purely altruistic, sometimes serving good begrudgingly

## Character Development Goals

1. Integrate clerical and monastic practices by finding spiritual connections between St. Sebaldus teachings and eastern techniques
2. Build personal power base independent from family control
3. Develop trust with select allies who might eventually accept her true identity
4. Master combat techniques that allow effectiveness while maintaining noble appearance
5. Find personal resolution between public and private identities
