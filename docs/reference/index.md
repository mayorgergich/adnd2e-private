# AD&D 2E Reference

This section contains reference materials pulled from official AD&D 2E sources and wikis. The content is automatically imported and updated to provide quick access to game rules and information.

## Available References

The following reference materials are available:

- [Classes](/docs/reference/classes/index) - Information about character classes in AD&D 2E
- [Races](/docs/reference/races/index) - Information about playable races in AD&D 2E

## Source Attribution

Content in this section is sourced from:

- [adnd2e.fandom.com](https://adnd2e.fandom.com) - The AD&D 2E Wiki

## How This Works

This reference section uses the `docusaurus-plugin-remote-content` plugin to automatically pull content from external sources and integrate it into our documentation. This ensures that the reference materials are up-to-date without requiring manual maintenance.

If you'd like to add more reference sources, you can modify the plugin configuration in the `docusaurus.config.js` file.
