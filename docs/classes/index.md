![Bard](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/adnd2e/images/8/82/Bard.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20230205121904)

### [Bard](/docs/bard)

(Rogue Group)

_Bards make their way in life by their charm, talent, and wit. A good bard should be glib of tongue, light of heart, and fleet of foot (when all else fails)._

![Cleric](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/adnd2e/images/8/88/Cleric.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20230205121904)

### [Cleric](/docs/cleric)

(Priest Group)

_The Cleric is a generic priest (of any mythos) who tends to the needs of a community. They are both protector and healer. They are not purely defensive, however. When evil threatens, the cleric is well-suited to seek it out on its own ground and destroy it._
