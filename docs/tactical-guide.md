## Specialized Combat Scenarios

### Against Supernatural Threats

The rising Hussite conflict and supernatural beliefs prevalent in 1420s Nuremberg make encounters with spiritual threats possible.

**Against Demonic/Evil Entities:**
- Lead with **Protection from Evil** for enhanced defense
- Use quarterstaff as primary weapon (described in lore as effective against spirits)
- Channel divine energy through eastern techniques (maximizing both skillsets)
- Use religious authority to attempt to command lesser spirits

**Against Possession/Mind Control:**
- Activate **Remove Fear** to enhance saves against mental effects
- Use meditative techniques to strengthen mental resistance
- Maintain distance until protection spells are active
- Target the controller rather than the controlled when possible

### Against Church Opposition

As tensions rise in the region, you may face opponents from within the church or state who oppose your actions.

**Against Church Authorities:**
- Emphasize your family connections and noble status
- Present conventional clerical abilities, concealing eastern techniques
- Use non-lethal approaches to avoid escalating conflict
- Leverage your knowledge of church politics and hierarchies

**Against Secular Authorities:**
- Invoke clerical immunity where applicable
- Use your family's patrician status for protection
- Demonstrate respect while maintaining your position
- Rely on social tactics rather than physical confrontation

## Roleplaying Your Combat Style

### Public Persona vs. Private Techniques

As Augustus, you must carefully manage how your combat abilities are perceived by different audiences.

**Public Combat Style:**
- Somewhat clumsy but effective staff techniques
- Apparent reliance on divine intervention
- Hesitant, almost reluctant combat approach
- Dramatic invocations to St. Sebaldus

**Private Combat Style:**
- Fluid, precise movements revealing eastern training
- Balanced integration of divine and monastic abilities
- Confident, controlled techniques
- Minimal verbal components, focused on breath and form

### Combat Dialogue Examples

**Public Setting:**
- "St. Sebaldus guide my hand!" (when attacking)
- "By the grace of Heaven, I stand protected." (when defending)
- "I prefer not to fight, but the church demands justice." (when initiating combat)
- "Most unexpected! The saint has blessed me with unusual strength." (after a particularly effective strike)

**Private Setting:**
- Minimal speech, focused on controlled breathing
- "Center. Flow. Strike." (personal mantra)
- "The mountain does not fear the wind." (eastern teaching when facing powerful foes)
- "Both river and stone." (reminder to balance offense and defense)

## Progressive Revelation Strategy

As your adventures continue, you may choose to gradually reveal more of your true capabilities to trusted companions. This strategic progression allows for character development while maintaining necessary secrets.

### Level 5+: Integrated Identity
- For trusted companions, demonstrate full integration of both traditions
- Develop unique fighting style that openly combines eastern and western techniques
- Frame eastern techniques as "lost teachings of St. Sebaldus revealed through prayer"
- Create personal synthesis of clerical and monastic traditions
