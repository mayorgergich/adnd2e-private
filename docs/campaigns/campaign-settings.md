## Creating Your Own Setting

Many DMs prefer to create their own unique worlds. When designing a campaign setting, consider:

1. **Geography** - Map out major regions, cities, and natural features
2. **Politics** - Establish kingdoms, factions, and their relationships
3. **History** - Create a timeline of significant events
4. **Magic** - Determine how magic works and its place in society
5. **Religions** - Design pantheons and religious organizations

Your setting should provide diverse adventure opportunities while maintaining internal consistency. Start small with a particular region, then expand as your campaign progresses.

## Adapting Published Adventures

When running published adventures in your chosen setting:

1. Substitute location names to match your world
2. Adjust NPCs to fit local cultures and politics
3. Modify monsters to match the setting's ecology
4. Connect adventure plots to your campaign's themes

Remember that the setting serves the adventure, not the other way around. Feel free to modify any aspect of a published setting to better suit your group's preferences.
