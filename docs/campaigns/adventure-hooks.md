# Adventure Hooks

Use these adventure hooks as starting points for your AD&D 2E campaigns or as side quests within your ongoing adventures.

## Urban Adventures

### The Guild War

Two rival thieves' guilds have escalated their conflict, and innocent merchants are getting caught in the crossfire. The city guard is overwhelmed, and the local ruler is seeking adventurers to help restore order.

### The Mysterious Tower

A wizard's tower has suddenly appeared in the city center overnight, where previously there was just an empty lot. Strange lights and sounds emanate from within, but no one has seen anyone enter or leave.

## Wilderness Adventures

### The Ancient Barrow

Farmers have discovered an ancient burial mound on the outskirts of their land. Since its discovery, livestock have gone missing, and villagers report seeing shadowy figures at night.

### The Lost Caravan

A merchant caravan has gone missing along a well-traveled trade route. The last message received mentioned strange mists and disorienting sounds.

## Dungeon Delves

### The Forgotten Mines

An old dwarf seeks adventurers to reclaim his clan's abandoned mines. He claims they were abandoned due to "bad air," but local rumors suggest a darker reason.

### The Sunken Temple

After an earthquake, a sinkhole has revealed an entrance to an ancient temple dedicated to a forgotten deity. Strange cultists have been seen entering the ruins.

## Maritime Adventures

### The Ghost Ship

A ship thought lost at sea years ago has been spotted drifting near the coast. No crew can be seen aboard, and ships sent to investigate haven't returned.

### The Island of Mists

Fishermen tell tales of an uncharted island that appears only during certain phases of the moon. Those who have visited speak of strange ruins and valuable treasures.

## How to Use These Hooks

Each of these adventure hooks can be expanded into a full adventure or campaign. Consider the following when developing them:

1. **Adjust for party level** - Scale encounters and rewards based on your party's experience
2. **Connect to character backgrounds** - Tie the adventure to your players' backstories
3. **Add complications** - Introduce unexpected elements to keep players engaged
4. **Provide multiple solutions** - Allow for different approaches to problems

Remember that the best adventures often arise from player choices, so be ready to adapt these hooks based on your group's actions and interests.
