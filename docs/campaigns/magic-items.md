# Magic Items and Artifacts

Magic items and legendary artifacts can serve as excellent plot devices, quest objectives, or rewards in your AD&D 2E campaigns. This guide provides inspiration for creating unique magical treasures with rich histories and capabilities.

## Creating Compelling Magic Items

### Beyond Basic Bonuses

The most memorable magic items go beyond simple numerical bonuses. Consider including:

1. **Unique Appearance** - Distinctive visual elements that make the item recognizable
2. **History** - A backstory that connects the item to your world's lore
3. **Side Effects** - Minor magical effects that occur during use
4. **Personality** - For intelligent items, a distinctive character with goals
5. **Evolution** - Items that grow in power as characters advance

### Sample Unique Items

#### The Winterfrost Blade

- **Appearance**: A longsword with a blade that appears to be carved from ice, with swirling patterns that shift like snowflakes
- **Powers**: +1 bonus to attack and damage, deals additional 1d4 cold damage
- **Special**: Once per day can create a 15-foot cone of frost (as per the spell Cone of Cold at 5th level)
- **History**: Forged by frost giants and gifted to a human hero who saved their clan from a white dragon
- **Side Effect**: The wielder's breath becomes visible as if in cold air, regardless of temperature

#### Cloak of the Night Sky

- **Appearance**: A deep blue cloak with tiny points of light that twinkle like stars
- **Powers**: Grants +2 bonus to all saving throws made during nighttime hours
- **Special**: Three times per week, can cast Invisibility on the wearer, but only outdoors at night
- **History**: Created by a moon elf enchantress who used it to rescue her people during a nighttime raid
- **Side Effect**: The wearer's eyes reflect light like a cat's eyes at night

## Legendary Artifacts

Unlike typical magic items, artifacts are unique objects of immense power, often with their own agendas and significant drawbacks.

### Artifact Design Guidelines

1. **Overwhelming Power** - Artifacts should feel significantly more powerful than standard magic items
2. **Serious Drawbacks** - Great power comes with great risk or cost
3. **Plot Significance** - Artifacts should tie into major campaign storylines
4. **Limited Control** - Users rarely fully master artifacts; the items have their own "will"
5. **Multiple Functions** - Artifacts typically have several powers, some of which may be unknown initially

### Sample Artifacts

#### The Codex of Infinite Planes

- **Appearance**: A massive tome bound in metal and leather from unknown creatures, pages shift and change when not observed
- **Powers**:
  - Grants knowledge of planar lore and languages
  - Can create temporary portals to other planes
  - Allows communication with extraplanar entities
- **Drawbacks**:
  - Each use risks drawing unwanted attention from powerful planar beings
  - Extended study causes increasing mental instability
  - If dropped or damaged, may create uncontrolled planar rifts
- **History**: Created by a mad archmage who sought to catalog all planes of existence, eventually driven to merge with the multiverse itself

#### The Crown of Whispers

- **Appearance**: A simple silver circlet that seems to fade from view when not directly observed
- **Powers**:
  - Allows wearer to hear thoughts within 30 feet
  - Can implant suggestions in weak-minded individuals
  - Reveals illusions and hidden doors
- **Drawbacks**:
  - Constantly whispers secrets and paranoid thoughts to the wearer
  - Slowly turns the wearer against allies through subtle manipulation
  - Creates an addiction to secrets and hidden knowledge
- **History**: Created by an ancient king's court wizard to help identify assassins and plotters, eventually caused the king's descent into paranoia and the kingdom's collapse

## Integrating Magic Items Into Campaigns

### As Quest Objects

- Create adventures centered around finding or destroying powerful items
- Establish competing factions who seek the item for different purposes
- Design dungeons or challenges specifically related to the item's nature

### As Rewards

- Consider the impact on game balance before awarding powerful items
- Link item powers to character backgrounds or class abilities
- Allow items to grow with characters through quests or achievements

### As Plot Devices

- Use items as communication tools from distant NPCs or deities
- Create conflicts arising from an item's history or former owners
- Design prophecies or legends centered around magical artifacts

## Cursed Items

Cursed items add an element of risk and caution to treasure hunting. Consider these approaches:

1. **Disguised Curses** - Items initially appear beneficial but reveal drawbacks with use
2. **Double-Edged Powers** - Great benefits with significant costs
3. **Gradual Corruption** - Items that slowly change the wielder over time
4. **Removal Challenges** - Curses that require specific quests or conditions to remove

Remember that magic items should enhance storytelling and character development, not simply provide mechanical advantages. The best items become characters in their own right, with histories that intertwine with your campaign's narrative.
